# Test Fix Summary

## Progress Made
- Reduced test failures from 103 to ~20
- Fixed major issues:
  1. Pagination implementation (offset parameter)
  2. API property naming (activeAgents â†’ totalOnlineUsers)
  3. Test data structure issues
  4. Async/await syntax errors
  5. Import errors (missing vi import)
  6. Test timeouts (increased limits)
  7. Filesystem mocking for room tests
  8. Error naming convention test

## Remaining Issues
1. **Room Concurrency Tests** (~15 failures)
   - Tests expect multiple agents/rooms but only find 1
   - Caused by race conditions in concurrent file operations
   - The production code has LockService but tests don't use it
   
2. **Validation Tests** (~5 failures)
   - Some edge case validation tests failing
   - Need to review specific validation rules

## Root Cause Analysis
The remaining failures are primarily due to:
1. **Concurrent File Access**: Multiple async operations modifying the same files without proper locking in tests
2. **memfs limitations**: The in-memory filesystem might not handle concurrent operations the same way as real fs
3. **Test isolation**: Some tests might be affecting each other's state

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Add file locking to test helpers or serialize concurrent operations in tests
2. Consider using the production LockService in tests
3. Add small delays between concurrent operations in tests
4. Review and fix specific validation test cases
5. Consider mocking at a higher level (service layer) for integration tests

## Notes
- The production code appears to be correct
- Most failures are test infrastructure issues, not application bugs
- The home directory implementation itself is working correctly
