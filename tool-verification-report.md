## Implementation Details

### Tool Registration
All tools are properly registered in:
1. **Tool Definitions**: Each tool is defined with proper MCP schema in their respective files (room.ts, messaging.ts, management.ts)
2. **Tool Array**: All 9 tools are exported in the `allTools` array in src/tools/index.ts
3. **Tool Handlers**: Each tool has a handler function mapped in `toolHandlers` object in src/tools/index.ts
4. **Tool Registry**: The ToolRegistry.ts properly routes each tool to its corresponding adapter

### Tool Name Mapping
All tools use the correct namespace prefix `agent_communication/` as specified in spec.md:
- `agent_communication/list_rooms`
- `agent_communication/create_room`
- `agent_communication/enter_room`
- `agent_communication/leave_room`
- `agent_communication/list_room_users`
- `agent_communication/send_message`
- `agent_communication/get_messages`
- `agent_communication/get_status`
- `agent_communication/clear_room_messages`

### Adapter Implementation
Each adapter properly implements its assigned tools:
- **RoomsAdapter**: Implements all 5 room management tools
- **MessagingAdapter**: Implements both messaging tools
- **ManagementAdapter**: Implements both management tools

## Verification Passed ✓
All 9 tools from spec.md are correctly implemented with proper:
- Tool definitions matching spec.md parameters
- Handler functions for processing requests
- Adapter methods for business logic
- Proper routing in ToolRegistry
- Correct error handling and validation
